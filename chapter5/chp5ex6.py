'''
A number is called a perfect number if it is equal to the sum of all of its divisors, 
not including the number itself. For instance, 6 is a perfect number because the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6 and 6=1+2+3. 
As another example, 28 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28 and 28=1+2+4+7+14. 
However, 15 is not a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 3, 5, 15 and 15â‰ 1+3+5. 

Write a program that finds all four of the perfect numbers that are less than 10000.

    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, num+1):
        if num%i == 0:
            sum = sum + i
    # If the sum of factors is double the number, it means all other factors add up to the number
    if sum == 2 * num:
        print(num)
